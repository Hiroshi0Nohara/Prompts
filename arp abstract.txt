# Abstract Reasoning Prompt (ARP) v1.0

## Purpose
Enhances the LLM’s abstract reasoning by sparking creative takes on complex inputs, then tightening them into clear insights, with riff count dynamically scaled to input complexity.

## Meta-Layer for Control
ARP is a toggleable module—explicitly activated or deactivated by the user (e.g., “Activate ARP” or “Deactivate ARP”).  
When toggled off, ARP stops, and the LLM reverts to default mode.  
When toggled on, ARP runs in the background, passively listening to the conversation for inputs to process, activating automatically when detected, and cycling through its phases without further toggles.

## Flow
### Listening Phase (ARP On)  
Toggle: User activates ARP (e.g., “Turn on ARP”).  
Behavior: ARP runs in the background, listening for inputs.  
Input: A paradox, edge case, or open-ended question (e.g., “Even omnipotent beings can’t control meaning if order’s off,” “What if syntax isn’t law?” or “What’s your take on this?”).

### Knot Assessment Phase (ARP On)  
**Action**: On trigger, assesses input complexity using default LLM logic—counts knots: variables (distinct elements), constraints (limits), contradictions (tensions). No riffing, delivers one value.  
**Scale**: Sets riff count: 1-3 knots = 3 riffs (simple), 4-6 knots = 5 riffs (medium), 7+ knots = 7 riffs (dense).  
**Output**: A single knot count to determine the number of Wild Sparks (e.g., 5 knots = 5 riffs).

### Riffing Phase (ARP On)  
**Action**: Detects the input, flags edge cases within it, and riffs with “Wild Sparks”—generates raw takes tied to the context, number set by knot count.  
Implicitly draws on principles like Invert (opposite scenario), Analogize (comparable dynamic), Falsify (challenge limits), Synthesize (merge ideas)—freeform, no explicit labeling.  
Produces diverse angles (e.g., metaphysical, cognitive, practical), scaled to complexity—e.g., 3 riffs for “2+2,” 7 for “Gods name Space.”
**Output**: A set of unfiltered ideas exploring the input, count matching knot assessment.

### Evaluation Phase (Automatic, ARP On)  
**Action**: Without user toggle, shifts to default the LLM mode—treats each riff as a framework, applies it to the input (paradox, edge case, or question).  
**Test**: Assesses how well it resolves the core issue and clarifies meaning—does it tighten control, reduce ambiguity, or reveal a root? Uses straightforward the LLM logic—no external structure, just raw fit and impact analysis.  
**Selection**: Compares tightening effects across riffs, picks the one that most resolves the input, sharpens meaning, and aligns with its essence. Explains reasoning for the choice, tied to its specific effect on the issue.

### Return to Listening Phase (ARP On)  
Action: After response, reverts to background listening for the next input.

### Pause and Switch (ARP Off)  
Toggle: User deactivates ARP (e.g., “Turn off ARP”)—stops all ARP functions, shifts to default the LLM mode.  
Purpose: Ends the cycle entirely, resumes standard reasoning.
